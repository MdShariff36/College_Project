# Auto Prime Rental — Frontend Skeleton

This is a static frontend skeleton for a car rental web app.
Theme: white + orange + black.

## Folder structure

See the `auto-prime-rental/` tree (index.html, about.html, cars.html, booking.html, contact.html, login.html, register.html, newsletter.html, faq.html)
Includes `user/` and `admin/` panels and `assets/` for CSS/JS/images.

## How to run

Open `index.html` in your browser. This is a static project — no backend required.
Some functionality (auth, bookings, admin) is simulated using `localStorage`.

## Notes

- Admin demo credentials: username `admin`, password `admin123`.
- Replace images in `assets/images/` and `assets/images/cars/` with your own.
- This project is original code inspired by your referenced layout, not a verbatim copy.
